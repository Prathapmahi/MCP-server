Monkeys belong to the primate order, which also includes apes, lemurs, and humans.
There are over 260 species of monkeys, divided into New World monkeys (from the Americas) and Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia).
The smallest monkey is the pygmy marmoset, weighing around 100 grams, while the largest is the mandrill, which can weigh up to 35 kg.
Most monkeys are omnivorous, eating fruits, nuts, insects, and sometimes small vertebrates.
Many monkey species are highly social and live in groups called troops, which can range from a few individuals to over 100.
Unlike apes, most monkeys have tails, though not all monkey tails are prehensile (able to grasp objects).
The Japanese macaque, or snow monkey, is famous for bathing in hot springs during winter.
Many monkey species are endangered due to habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade.
Capuchin monkeys are considered among the most intelligent monkey species and can use tools in the wild.
The howler monkey has one of the loudest calls in the animal kingdom, which can be heard up to 3 miles away.
MONKEY SUMMARY: Monkeys are primates (related to apes, lemurs and humans) with over 260 species divided between New and Old World varieties. They range in size from tiny pygmy marmosets (100g) to large mandrills (35kg). Most are omnivorous, social creatures living in troops of varying sizes, and have tails (unlike apes). Notable species include tool-using capuchins, hot spring-bathing Japanese macaques, and extremely loud howler monkeys. Unfortunately, many monkey species face endangerment due to habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade.
Spider monkeys have extremely long limbs and no thumbs, making them perfectly adapted for swinging through trees with incredible speed and agility.
Proboscis monkeys are found only in Borneo and are famous for their large, inflated noses that amplify their calls and attract mates.
Baboons have complex social hierarchies and can form alliances, hold grudges, and even engage in political behavior within their troops.
Golden lion tamarins have distinctive manes and were once critically endangered, but conservation efforts have helped increase their population in Brazilian rainforests.
Vervet monkeys have different alarm calls for different predators - eagles, leopards, and snakes each trigger distinct warning vocalizations.
Rhesus macaques are excellent swimmers and some populations live on islands, diving for food and crossing water channels between landmasses.
Squirrel monkeys have the largest brain-to-body ratio of any primate except humans, making them incredibly intelligent despite their small size.
Colobus monkeys are primarily leaf-eaters with specialized stomachs containing bacteria that help them digest tough plant material.
Macaque monkeys in some regions have learned to use stones as tools to crack open shellfish and nuts, passing these skills down through generations.
Night monkeys (also called owl monkeys) are the only truly nocturnal monkeys, with large eyes adapted for seeing in darkness and monogamous pair bonds.
